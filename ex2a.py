'''exercise 2
a)write a program to compute distance between two points taking input from the user
pythagorean theorem'''
\pythagorean theorem is A^2+B^2=c^2
import math
x = input("enter the first point :")
y = input("enter the second point :")
z = (x**2+y**2)
squt =z**0.5
print "The distance between two points is :",squt
